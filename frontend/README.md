# Frontend

This directory will house the React + TypeScript application (e.g., Vite-based) with feature-oriented folders. Use the shared repository linting and formatting configurations at the root to keep consistent code style across the stack.

Planned substructure (as the app is scaffolded):
- `src/` for application code.
- `public/` for static assets.
- `tests/` for unit/component tests.
- `e2e/` for end-to-end tests when introduced.
