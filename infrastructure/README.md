# Infrastructure

This directory will capture infrastructure-as-code, deployment manifests, and local development tooling. It should rely on the shared linting and formatting settings at the repository root.

Planned substructure (as infrastructure is added):
- `deploy/` for environment manifests (e.g., Kubernetes, Terraform modules).
- `local/` for Docker Compose and local tooling.
- `ci/` for CI/CD workflow definitions.
